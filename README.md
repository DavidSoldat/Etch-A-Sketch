# Etch-A-Sketch

Etch-A-Sketch project where you can chose color to draw somethign on the grid. Grid can be resized as you wish (from 1 field to 64x64 fields). Also you can chose ranibow mode, where instead of coloring all fields with same color, colors are randomly selected (therefore rainbow name). This little project is done with vanilla JS and TailwindCSS.
